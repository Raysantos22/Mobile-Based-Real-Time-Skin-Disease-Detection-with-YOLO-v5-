Mobile-Based Real-Time Skin Disease Detection with YOLO v5 (Winner of TSU 2024 Best Thesis Award)

Developed a standalone, offline mobile app using Java/Kotlin for real-time skin disease detection with an accuracy of 95.20%. The app leverages YOLO 
v5 implemented with TensorFlow/PyTorch and utilizes OpenCV for image processing. The application can detect 12 common skin diseases, including acne, 
bullous pemphigoid, herpes zoster, hives, impetigo, melanonychia, monkeypox, psoriasis, ringworm, warts, cutaneous-larva-migrans, and Raynaud's phenomenon.
with high precision (94.80%), specificity (96.10%), and recall (95.50%).
